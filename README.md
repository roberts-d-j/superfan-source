# Tech Elevator Final Capstone - Fan Band (Superfan Source)
â€‹
For this capstone, we were assigned a product owner who gave us specifications for the project we were to build. Our product owner requested a 90s themed website where music fans would be able to connect with the bands they enjoyed, as well as receive messages from them.

The project was completed over a two week period in an agile development environment, with three sprints each spanning three days and a final day for code cleanup and unification. Minimum viable product was achieved, as well as an aesthetic that exceeded expectations of both product owner and scrum director. 

I primarily worked in the backend, building the JdbcDao and Service classes as well as the endpoints for most of the application's database functionality. I also supplied some of the styling templates that were applied to the majority of the interactive elements of the application.
